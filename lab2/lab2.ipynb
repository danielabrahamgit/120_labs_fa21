However, the input array `x` is of finite length `len(x)` (i.e. not periodic). So how can we expect to use the Fourier series formulas? The answer is to just assume that `x` is just one period of an `N` periodic signal, where `N = len(x)`. This variation of applying the DTFS formula to some time interval of an aperiodic signal is known as the DFT (discrete Fourier transform), and is widely used in many applications.

In addition, the functions that you wrote `get_fourier_coeffs` and `recon`, as amazing as they were, are simply not fast enough. For reasons that we will explore later in the class, there is a much faster way of computing the Fourier series coefficients of a signal. For that reason, we use the staff solution, which utilizes the *FFT* (fast Fourier transform - more on this later in the course). However, we will still be using your implementation of `M_most_sig`! \n",
